"""
Reinforcement learning components for the reference experiment.

This folder contains a deliberately scoped PPO implementation
designed to expose learning dynamics, failure modes, and
stability trade-offs in priority-aware scheduling.

The goal is not peak performance, but transparency and fidelity
to observed behavior in constrained environments.
